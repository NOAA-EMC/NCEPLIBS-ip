Unit test for the NCEP IPOLATES library (IPLIB).

ABSTRACT:
---------

This test invokes IPOLATES to interpolate scalar and
vector data to several grids of various map projections
using all IPOLATES interpolation options.  The output 
is compared to baseline data and a summary of differences is
sent to standard output.


HOW THE TEST WORKS:
-------------------

There are two separate programs to test the scalar and vector interpolation.
The scalar program calls routine 'ipolates' to interpolate a global field
of snow albedo to several grids of various map projections and
using all IPOLATES interpolation options.  Likewise, the vector program
calls routine 'ipolatev' to interpolate a global field of 500mb u/w wind.
The specific tests are:

  - grid 3 (global one-deg lat/lon) using bilinear (IP option "0")
  - grid 8 (mercator) using bicubic (IP option "1")
  - grid 127 (gaussian lat/lon) using neighbor (IP option "2")
  - grid 203 (rotated lat/lon "E") using budget (IP option "3")
  - grid 205 (rotated lat/lon "B") using spectral (IP option "4")
  - grid 212 (polar stereographic) using neighbor-budget (IP option "6")
  - grid 218 (lambert conformal) using bilinear (IP option "0")

Some grid numbers refer to an NCEP grib 1 standard grid.  Others
refer to the grib 1 data representation type.

The output from each call to ipolates and ipolatev is compared to its
baseline counterpart in the ./baseline data directory.  This baseline 
data was created using the Intel Fortran compiler.  Differences from
the baseline data are computed and sent to standard output. For this
unit test to pass the differences should be "small".


DIRECTORY LAYOUT:
-----------------

./sorc - Contains the files and scripts needed to build the
         unit test programs.  And the programs themselves.

./sorc/scalar -
         Contains a Fortran program to call routine 'ipolates'
         to interpolate a global field of albedo data to
         several grids and using all interpolation options.

./sorc/vector -
         Contains a Fortran program to call routine 'ipolatev'
         to interpolate a global field of u/v wind data to
         several grids and using all interpolation options.

./exec - Contains the unit test executables.  There is one executable
         for the single ("4"), double ("8") and mixed ("d") precision
         versions of the IPOLATES library:

         scalar_4.exe  scalar_8.exe  scalar_d.exe
         vector_4.exe  vector_8.exe  vector_d.exe

./work - The working directory for program execution.

./lib  - The location of the IPOLATES libraries and module files as
         expected by the unit test programs.

./scripts - Contains scripts to run this unit test.

./input_data - Contains the input scalar and vector data.  The 
               data are in binary little endian format:

               ./scalar/global_snoalb.bin    (global snow albedo)
               ./vector/global_uv_wind.bin   (global 500mb u/v wind)

./baseline_data - Contains the baseline set of scalar and vector data 
                  interpolated to each target grid. Binary, little endian
                  format.  Output from each call to routine ipolates and
                  ipolatev is compared to its baseline counterpart.  There
                  are sub-directories for the scalar and vector data.
                  And under these sub-directories, there are sub-directories
                  for the single (4_byte_bin) and mixed/double (8_byte_bin)
                  versions of the IPOLATES library.  The file names
                  contain the grid number and IPOLATES interpolation
                  option (defined below); i.e.:

                  grid${gridnum}.opt${ip_option}.bin_4/8

                  Grads control files to view each file are located in the
                  ./grads subdirectory.  These files do not account
                  for map projection.  Rather, they display the data
                  as a 2-D field with no interpolation.  So when
                  viewing, do a "set mproj off" during your grads session.
                  


HOW TO RUN THE TEST:
--------------------

1) Build the IPOLATES library.  Go to $root and read the
README.build file for details.  


2) Ensure the ./lib directory contains (or links to) the IPOLATES libraries and
its module files.  The ./lib directory already contains links that point to the
libraries and module files as they would exist when using the "nco" install
option from step (1).  I.e:

 module file directories:
   incmod_4 -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_4  (single precision)
   incmod_d -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_d  (mixed precision)
   incmod_8 -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_8  (double precistion)

 libraries:
   libip_4.a -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_4.a   (single precision)
   libip_d.a -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_d.a   (mixed precision)
   libip_8.a -> $root/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_8.a   (double precistion)

So if that is how IPOLATES was built in step (1), there is
nothing more to do. 

However, if you want to build with another version of the library,
or if you built them in step (1) using the "gnu" or "nco_cray" install option,
you will need to adjust these links.  Example: Suppose you want to
test with the OPS version of IPOLATES on WCOSS Phase 2.  You would set the
links as follows:

  incmod_4 -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_4
  incmod_d -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_d
  incmod_8 -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/include/ip_vX.Y.Z_8
 
  libip_4.a -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_4.a
  libip_d.a -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_d.a
  libip_8.a -> /nwprod2/lib/ip/vX.Y.Z/libip_vX.Y.Z_8.a


3) Build the "scalar" and "vector" unit test programs 
by running the "make_unit_test.ksh" build script.  (Use the 
"make_unit_test_wcoss-cray.ksh" build script on WCOSS-Cray.)

The IPOLATES library is dependant on the NCEP SP 
(spectral) library (SPLIB).  Intel compiled versions of SPLIB
exist on Theia and WCOSS Phase 1/2.  When running "make_unit_test.ksh"
on these machines, these SP libraries are automatically located
by module loads and stored in these environment variables:

 SP_LIB4 (single precision)
 SP_LIBd (mixed precision)
 SP_LIB8 (double precistion)

On WCOSS-Cray, Intel and Cray compiled versions of SPLIB exist.
And the "make_unit_test_wcoss-cray.ksh" script will locate
them by module loads. 

If you are testing on a machine other than WCOSS or Theia, 
or you have compiled IPOLATES with a compiler other than Intel or Cray,
you will need to locate (or build) SPLIB and set these environment
varibles by editing the build script, or by exporting these
variables on the command line before invoking it.
Example (when using bash):

 $ export SP_LIB4=$directory/libsp_4.a

Once the SP libraries have been located, run "make_unit_test.ksh" 
(or make_unit_test_wcoss-cray.ksh) from the command line.  The script 
takes one argument: the "config-setup" file that was used to compile
IPOLATES. So, if you built IPOLATES with the Intel-optimized option, 
you would invoke as follows:

 $ make_unit_test.ksh ifort.setup

On WCOSS-Cray, you would do the following:

 $ make_unit_test_wcoss-cray.ksh ifort.setup


4) Run the unit test.  Go to ./scripts.  To run interactively, type:

 $ run_unit_test.ksh

You may want to pipe the output to a log fle.  Check output for any 
"large" differences between the computed and baseline data.

To run "run_unit_test.ksh" on the WCOSS or Theia compute nodes,
invoke these driver scripts as follows:

 $ run_wcoss.ksh       (WCOSS Phase 1/2)
 $ run_wcoss-cray.ksh  (WCOSS-Cray)
 $ run_wcoss-dell.ksh  (WCOSS-Phase 3/Dell)
 $ qsub run_theia.ksh  (Theia)

In this case, output is sent to "unit_test.log".
