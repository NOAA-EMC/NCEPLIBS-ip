Test gdswiz and gdswzd and all of their child routines
to calculate lat/lon and other map-related fields for several
grids of various map projections.

The following grids are tested:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
201          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizc9 and gdswzdc9
202          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizca and gdswzdca
203          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizcb and gdswzdcb
205          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizcd and gdswzdcd
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
213          sh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)
222          nh polar stereographic, elliptical earth (number meaningless)

The routines are called twice to test both the (1) i/j to lat/lon
and (2) lat/lon to i/j conversions.  (1) is invoked by setting the IOPT
argument to '0' and (2) is invoked by setting it to '-1'. This operation
should be reversable.  If it is not reversable within floating point
differences, a warning message is printed to standard output and the 
regression test is considered failed.

The latitude, longitude and all other computed map fields (such as 
grid box area and rotation factors) are output to separate binary files
after each call to gdswiz/wzd.  The file naming convention is:
grid${gridnum}.iopt${0/m1}.bin.  These files may be visualized
in GRADS using the control files in the ./grads subdirectory.
The binary files from a 'control' and 'test' are compared
in the runall.ksh script.  If not bit identical, the test fails.

The Fortran source code and make-related files are located in 
the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script
comments for more information.  The executables are stored in
the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
