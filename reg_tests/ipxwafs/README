Test ip routines ipxwafs, ipxwafs2 and ipxwafs3 by transforming between
full and thinned WAFS grids.  The full grids have the same number of
points in each row.  In the thinned grids, the number of points in each
row decrease toward the pole. These transforms are performed using a
Fortran program.

The program reads in a grib 2 file of data on the full/thinned WAFS
grid and transforms it to its thinned/full counterpart.  Routine
ipxwafs transforms data without bitmaps.  Routines ipxwafs2 and
ipxwafs3 transform data with bitmaps - the former uses bilinear
interpolation and the latter uses nearest neighbor.  The transformed
data is written to a grib 2 file.

The program source code and the make-related files are in the
./sorc subdirectory.  The code is compiled with all byte
versions of the 'control' and 'test' ip libraries:

  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

To compile, invoke the make_reg_tests.ksh script located
in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information.  The executables (a total
of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

The input data for the program is located in the /data subdirectory.
All input data are in grib 2 format.  The files are:

  wafs.37.full.bitmap.grb2 (soil T on full WAFS grid #37 - land only)
  wafs.37.full.grb2        (600 mb T on full WAFS grid #37)
  wafs.37.thin.bitmap.grb2 (soil T on thinned WAFS grid #37 - land only)
  wafs.37.thin.grb2        (600 mb T on thinned WAFS grid #37)
  wafs.44.full.bitmap.grb2 (soil T on full WAFS grid #44 - land only)
  wafs.44.full.grb2        (600 mb T on full WAFS grid #44)
  wafs.44.thin.bitmap.grb2 (soil T on thinned WAFS grid #44 - land only)
  wafs.44.thin.grb2        (600 mb T on thinned WAFS grid #44)

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the Runall.${machine}.ksh driver script located
in /reg_tests.

All output from the program is in grib 2.  If the grib 2 files from the
'control' and 'test' libraries are not bit identical, the
regression test is considered failed.
