Regression test for routine ipxetas.  Reads an input file
of vegetation greenness on a 'filled' 12km eta grid.  Then
calls ipxetas to:   

 1) create a staggered mass grid from the full grid.
 2) create a staggered velocity grid from the full grid.
 3) create a full grid from the staggered mass grid created by step (1)
 4) create a full grid from the staggered vel grid created by step (2)

Output from the control and test is written to binary files.
(Steps 1 and 2 written to "staggered.bin", and steps 3 and 4 written
to "full.bin").  These files may be viewed in Grads
with the ".ctl" files, located in the ./grads subdirectory.

The routine also outputs a kgds array used by the grib 1 (w3)
library.  The contents of the kgds array are output to a text
log file.  

The binary and log files from the 'control' and 'test' are
expected to be bit identical for the regression test to pass.

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information before compiling.  The executables reside
in the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
