Test the ipolatev suite of routines to interpolate a global lat/lon
grid of u/v wind (with bitmap) to several grids of
various map projections.  All available interpolation methods -
neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, spectral, budget, budget-neighbor -
are invoked.

These routines have threads, so this regression test is run twice -
with 1 and 4 threads.

The input u/v wind data is located in the ./data subdirectory.
It is in grib1 format.

This wind data is interpolated to the following grids:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
203          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
205          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)

The Fortran source code and executables are located in the ./src subdirectory.

The control and test programs are compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  Before compiling, see the script
comments for more information.  Program executables will hosted in the
./exec directory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' on zeus with the
runzeus.1.thread.ksh or runzeus.4.threads.ksh for 1/4 threads.
On ccs, use runccs.1.thread.ksh or runccs.4.threads.ksh
These scripts are in the ./scripts subdirectory.

The control and test programs output the interpolated u/v wind data to
direct access files.  These may be viewed in Grads with the ".ctl" files in
the ./grads subdirectory.  There is one ".ctl" file for each grid number.
