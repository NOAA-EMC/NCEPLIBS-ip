Test iplib routines ipsector, which creates a subsector of a 
larger two-dimensional field, and routine ipspaste, which
does the opposite.

More specically, read in a global dataset of substrate
temperature, then call ipsector to create a subsector of
the original grid.  Then call ipspaste to 'paste'
the subsectored data (created by call to ipsector) back
to the original grid.  The data returned from ipsector
should match the original data.

Three sets of calls to ipsector/ipspaste are made:
- for a North America subsector
- for a non-overlapping subsector
- for an overlapping subsector

Output from each step is written to binary files.  These file
may be viewed in Grads using the control files in the ./grads subdirectory.

The regression test fails if the 'control' and 'test' subsectored
data is not bit identical, or if the 'test' data from the
ipspaste step does not match the original data.

The routines have differing logic for different Grib 1 scan
modes.  So there are two input files of global substrate
temperature - one for scan mode '0' and one for scan mode '32'.
Both datasets are located in the ./data subdirectory.

The Fortran source code and make-related files are located 
in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script
comments for more information.  Program executables are stored
in the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.
