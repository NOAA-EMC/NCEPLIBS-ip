Invoke copygb to interpolate a global lat/lon grid of vegetation
greenness to numerous ncep standard grids.  Use all interpolation
options: 0-bilinear, 1-bicubic, 2-neighbor, 3-budget, 4-spectral,
6-neighbor-budget.

The ncep standard grid numbers are defined in the official
ncep grib documentation.
 
The input data is: /nwprod/fix/global_shdmax.0.144x0.144.grb

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information before compiling.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the proper driver script in the ./scripts subdirectory as follows:

"llsubmit run_ccs.ksh" (ccs machine)
"bsub < run_wcoss.ksh" (wcoss machine)
"qsub run_zeus.ksh" (zeus machine)

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it not
run as part of the full suite of tests from the "Runall"
driver script.

Note, the copygb executable in this directory is used as part of
the ipxwafs2_3 regression test.
