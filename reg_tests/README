The tests in the following subdirectories are designed to test 
a subset of IPLIB.  It was too difficult to create a single test
that exercised every routine.  No tests were created for routines
gdsawt and ijkgds, which I think are obsolete.

1)  gausslat - a fortran program that calls routine gausslat 
    to calculate the gaussian latitudes for a t382 grid.
2)  gcdist - a fortran program that calls function gcdist and 
    subroutine movect to calculate the distance of three great
    circle routes (and their corresponding rotation parameters).
3)  gdswiz_wzd - a fortran program that calls gdswiz and gdswzd
    (and all of their child routines) to calculate lat/lon and
    other map-related fields for several grids of
    of various map projections.
4)  ipmerge2 - a fortran program that calls routine
    ipmerge2, which merges two bitmapped fields into one.  
5)  ipolates - a fortran program that interpolates a global
    lat/lon grid of substrate temperature to several grids of various
    projections using the ipolates suite of routines.  All
    interpolation options (bilinear, neighbor, etc.) are used.
6)  ipolatev - a fortran program that interpolates a global
    lat/lon grid of vector u/v wind to several grids of various
    projections using the ipolatev suite of routines.  All
    interpolation options (bilinear, neighbor, etc.) are used.
7)  ipsector - a fortran program that tests routine ipsector,
    which which creates a subset of a larger
    two-dimensional field, and routine ipspaste, which does the
    opposite.
8)  ipxetas - a fortran program that reads a field of
    vegetation greenness on a unstaggered eta grid, then 
    calls routine ipxetas to do the following transforms:
      1) create a staggered mass grid from the unstaggered grid.
      2) create a staggered velocity grid from the unstaggered grid.
      3) create an unstaggered grid from the staggered mass grid created by step (1)
      4) create an unstaggered grid from the staggered vel grid created by step (2)
9)  ipxwafs2_3 - test ip routines ipxwafs2 and ipxwafs3 by transforming
    a global grid of 600 mb temperature (on ncep grid 3) to wafs grids 37 thru 44 
    using copygb. after the global to wafs grid transforms are
    completed, copygb is invoked again to transform temperature data on each
    wafs grid back to ncep grid 3.  note: routine ipxwafs2 is invoked 
    for interpolation option '0' (bilinear) and routine ipxwafs3 
    is invoked for interpolation option '2' (neighbor).
10) ipxwafs - same as experiment 9 except a specially modified version
    of copygb is used to call iplib routine ipxwafs instead of ipxwafs2. 
    ipxwafs and ipxwafs2 are the same except the latter accounts for bitmaps.
11) makgds - a fortran program to test routine makgds.  Routine is called
    three times.
      1) create gds and kgds arrays for ncep grid 3.  arrays hold grid
         description information used by w3 grib library.
      2) make kgds array for grid 3 from gds array
      3) make gds array for grid 3 from kgds array
12) polateg - a fortran program to call the polateg group of routines
    to interpolate temperature data on a 1-degree global lat/lon grid
    to a high-res global lat/lon grid, returning their vector gradients.
    Note: the polateg routines have several errors.  So, this test is
    not currently called from the regression driver scripts (listed below). 
13) copygb - the ncep copygb program is used to transform a global lat/lon file of
    vegetation greenness to numerous standard ncep grids using all available
    interpolation options (bilinear, nearest neighbor, etc.).  Because this 
    test can take over an hour of wall clock time, and calls the same
    routines as other regression tests, it is not currently called
    from the regression driver scripts.  However, it may be run stand-alone.

Within each subdirectory, the ./src subdirectory will contain any
source code required for the test.  Scripts to compile and run each
test are under the ./scripts subdirectory.  Executables will be
stored under the ./exec subdirectory.

In OPS, there are three versions of IPLIB:
  1) 4 byte integer/4 byte float (libip_4.a)
  2) 4 byte integer/8 byte float (libip_d.a)
  3) 8 byte integer/8 byte float (libip_8.a)
Each regression test compares the 'control' version of each library with
its correpsonding 'test' version.  The 'control' and 'test' versions
are determined by the user.

The entire suite of tests is compiled on zeus or ccs with the "Makeall.ksh"
script. See the script comments for more details on setup and compiling.
Each regression test will have six executables, one for each version of
IPLIB. The executables for the control library will be in ./exec/ctl and
those for the test library will be in ./exec/test.  To compile just a 
single regression test, invoke the "makeall.ksh" script located in that
particular test's ./scripts subdirectory.

After compilation, run the entire suite of tests on the ccs by
typing "llsubmit Runall.ccs.ksh".  On zeus, type "Runall.zeus.ksh"
Results are stored in "regression.log" in $WORK_DIR.  See the script
comments for more details.  To run just a single test, invoke the runall.ksh
script located in the ./scripts subdirectory.

Below is a table of each routine in iplib and which regression test(s) invoke it.
