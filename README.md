# Interpolation Library

The NCEP general interpolation library contains Fortran 90 subprograms to be
used for interpolating between nearly all grids used at NCEP. The library is
particularly efficient when interpolating many fields at one time. It also
contains routines for spectral transforms and other processing, including those
previously contained in the NCEPLIBS-sp library.

This is part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS)
project.

There are currently six interpolation methods available in the library:
- bilinear
- bicubic
- neighbor
- budget
- spectral
- neighbor-budget

For full documentation see https://noaa-emc.github.io/NCEPLIBS-ip/.

### Prerequisites

This package does not link to any other libraries, but requires CMake (version
3.15+) to build.

### Installing

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /path/to/NCEPLIBS-ip
make -j2
make test # (or ctest --verbose)
make install
```

### Usage

Most routines and any public interfaces required can be accessed by adding `use
ip_mod` to your Fortran code. Most spectral transform and processing subroutines
can be accessed by calling them in your code (no `use` statement) and linking
to the ip library at build time.
