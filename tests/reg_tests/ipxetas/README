Regression test for routine ipxetas.  A Fortran program 
does the following:

1) Convert land/sea mask on a rotated lat/lon unstaggered "full" grid
   to a rotated lat/lon "e"-staggered "h" point grid.
2) Convert land/sea mask on a rotated lat/lon unstaggered "full" grid
   to a rotated lat/lon "e"-staggered "v" point grid.
3) Convert land/sea mask on a rotated lat/lon "e"-staggered "h" point
   grid to a rotated lat/lon unstaggerd "full" grid.
4) Convert u-component wind on a rotated lat/lon "e"-staggered "v" point
   grid to a rotated lat/lon unstaggerd "full" grid.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' libraries by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./sorc subdirectory.  The executables are
(a total of six) stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

The input data (grib 2 format) is in ./data.

Output from the program is written to grib 2 files.

The output grib 2 files from the 'control' and 'test' ip2 libraries
are expected to be bit identical for the regression test to pass.

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the "Runall.${machine}" driver script located
in /reg_tests.
