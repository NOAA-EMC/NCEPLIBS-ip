Test the ipolatev suite of routines to interpolate a global lat/lon
grid of u/v wind (with bitmap) to several grids of
various map projections.  All available interpolation methods -
neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, spectral, budget, budget-neighbor -
are invoked.  A simple Fortran program is used.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control'
and 'test' ip2 libraries by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the /reg_tests directory.  See the
/reg_tests/README file for more information.

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./sorc subdirectory.  The executables (a total
of six) are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

These ipolatev routines have threads, so this regression test is run twice -
with 1 and 4 threads.

The input u/v wind data is located in the ./data subdirectory.
It is in grib 2 format.

This wind data is interpolated to the following grids:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
203          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number meaningless)
             this is the old 12km eta grid - 'v' pts
205          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number meaningless)
             this is the 12km nam grid - 'h' pts
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)

This regression test is run by the runall.ksh script
in the ./scripts subdirectory.  The runall.ksh script
is run by the "Runall.${machine}" driver script located
in ../reg_tests.

The interpolated wind data is written to binary files.
If the files from the 'control' and 'test' ip2 libraries
are not bit identical, the regression test is considered
failed.  Also, the files from the 1 and 4 thread 'test' libraries are compared.
If not bit identical, the regression test fails.  This comparison
is done by the ./scripts/compare.ksh script.

The binary files have the following naming convention: 
grid${grid#}.opt${option#}.${bytesize}byte.bin, where:

 Option#     Method
    0        BILINEAR
    1        BICUBIC
    2        NEIGHBOR
    3        BUDGET
    4        SPECTRAL
    6        NEIGHBOR-BUDGET

These binary files may be viewed in Grads with the ".ctl" files in
the ./grads subdirectory.  There is one ".ctl" file for each grid number.
