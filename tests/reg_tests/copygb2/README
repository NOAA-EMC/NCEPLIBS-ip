Regression test for ncep copygb2 program.

Invoke a modified version of copygb2 to interpolate global
lat/lon scalar and vector data to several grids of different
map projections.  copygb2 invokes routine "ipolates" for scalar
interpolation and "ipoloatv" for vector interpolation.  All
interpolation options are used:
   - bilinear
   - bicubic
   - neighbor
   - budget
   - spectral
   - neighbor-budget
 
The input data - in grib 2 format - is in the ./data directory.

The copygb2 source code and make-related files are located
in the ./sorc subdirectory.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control' and 'test' 
ip2lib by invoking the make_reg_test.ksh script located
in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information before compiling.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The executables (a total of six) are stored in the 
./exec subdirectory.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the proper driver script in the ./scripts subdirectory as follows:

"cat run.wcoss.lsf | bsub"       (wcoss phase 1/2 machine)
"cat run.wcoss-cray.lsf | bsub"  (wcoss cray machine)
"cat run.wcoss-dell.lsf | bsub"  (wcoss phase 3/Dell machine)
"sbatch run.theia.ksh"           (theia machine)

This driver script calls the copygb2.ksh child script located in ./scripts.

The interpolated data output from copygb2 is in grib 2 format.
If the grib 2 files from the 'control' and 'test' ip2lib are
not bit identical, the regression test is considered failed.

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it is NOT
run as part of the full suite of tests from the Runall.${machine}.ksh
driver in the ./reg_tests directory.
