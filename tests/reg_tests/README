HOW TO RUN THE REGRESSION TEST SUITE
---------------------------------------------------------------

The regression test suite consists of six Fortran programs
that invoke a subset of IPOLATES2 (or IP2LIB) routines.  
Developers are required to run this test suite to ensure their
branch changes perform as expected before they are merged to 
the master.

The following steps are required to setup and run the test suite:

(1) Compile the 'test' and 'control' IPOLATES2 libraries.

   The suite tests all three precision versions of IPOLATES2:

   -4 byte integer/4 byte float ("_4")
   -4 byte integer/8 byte float ("_d")
   -8 byte integer/8 byte float ("_8")

   The 'test' libraries are your branch copies, while 
   the 'control' libaries are the head of master.

(2) Link the 'test' and 'control' IPOLATES2 libraries and 
    their include directories (which contain their Fortran
    module files) to the ./reg_tests/lib directory
    in your branch.  

    The regression test build expects the 'test' and 'control'
    libraries and include directories in the ./reg_tests/lib 
    directory with the following names:

    libip2_ctl_4.a  (4 byte integer/4 byte float library, control)
    libip2_ctl_8.a  (8 byte integer/8 byte float library, control)
    libip2_ctl_d.a  (4 byte integer/8 byte float library, control)
    libip2_test_4.a  (4 byte integer/4 byte float library, test)
    libip2_test_8.a  (8 byte integer/8 byte float library, test)
    libip2_test_d.a  (4 byte integer/8 byte float library, test)

    incmod_ctl_4  (4 byte integer/4 byte float include dir, control)
    incmod_ctl_8  (8 byte integer/8 byte float include dir, control)
    incmod_ctl_d  (4 byte integer/8 byte float include dir, control)
    incmod_test_4 (4 byte integer/4 byte float include dir, test)
    incmod_test_8 (8 byte integer/8 byte float include dir, test)
    incmod_test_d (4 byte integer/8 byte float include dir, test)

    One way to place these libraries and include directories in 
    the ./reg_tests/lib directory is thru unix links.  Suppose
    the trunk and branch libraries were built using an
    'nco-style' installation.  First, change to the
    ./reg_tests/lib directory:

    "cd /branch/reg_tests/lib"

    Then, link each library and include directory to the 
    name expected by the regression test build:
    
    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_4.a  ./libip2_ctl_4.a"
    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_8.a  ./libip2_ctl_8.a"
    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_d.a  ./libip2_ctl_d.a"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_4.a  ./libip2_test_4.a"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_8.a  ./libip2_test_8.a"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/libip2_vX.Y.Z_d.a  ./libip2_test_d.a"

    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_4  ./incmod_ctl_4"
    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_8  ./incmod_ctl_8"
    "ln -s /master/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_d  ./incmod_ctl_d"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_4  ./incmod_test_4"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_8  ./incmod_test_8"
    "ln -s /branch/ip2/vX.Y.Z/include/ip2_vX.Y.Z_d  ./incmod_test_d"

(3) Check the ./reg_tests/config-setup/*.setup files in your branch.

    These files contain the compiler, compiler flags and link flags 
    used to compile the regression test suite.  There is one file
    for the Intel Fortran compiler (ifort.setup) and one for the
    Cray compiler (crayftn.setup).  The regression suite has
    been run with both compilers on WCOSS-Cray.  On WCOSS-Phase 1/2,
    WCOSS Dell (Phase 3) and Theia, only the Intel compiler has been used.
    You should not need to change the settings in these files.
    To use a different compiler, you will need to create
    your own "setup" file and point to it in the build script
    (see section 5).

(4) Ensure the build process can find the NCEP SP, W3NCO,
    BACIO, and G2 libraries.  The NCEP G2 library requires
    third party libraries JASPER, PNG AND Z.

    The build process is run by the "make_reg_tests.ksh"
    script (use the "make_reg_tests_wcoss-cray.sh" script
    on WCOSS-Cray).  The path/name of these libraries
    are stored in the following build script environment variables:
    
    SP_LIB4    - SP 4 byte integer/4 byte float version
    SP_LIB8    - SP 8 byte integer/8 byte float version
    SP_LIBd    - SP 4 byte integer/8 byte float version
    W3NCO_LIB4 - W3NCO 4 byte integer/4 byte float version
    W3NCO_LIB8 - W3NCO 8 byte integer/8 byte float version
    W3NCO_LIBd - W3NCO 4 byte integer/8 byte float version
    BACIO_LIB4 - BACIO 4 byte integer/4 byte float version
    BACIO_LIB8 - BACIO 8 byte integer/8 byte float version
    G2_LIB4    - G2 4 byte integer/4 byte float version
    G2_LIBd    - G2 4 byte integer/8 byte float version
    G2_LIB8    - G2 8 byte integer/8 byte float version
    JASPER_LIB - JASPER - only one verion
    PNG_LIB    - PNG - only one version
    Z_LIB      - Z - only one version

    The G2 library contains module files.  The path to these
    files are stored in these environment variables: 

    G2_INC4    - 4 byte integer/4 byte float version
    G2_INCd    - 4 byte integer/8 byte float version
    G2_INC8    - 8 byte integer/8 byte float version

    There is no mixed precision ("_d") version of BACIO.

    There is no official "8" byte integer/float version
    of G2.  A version exists on WCOSS Phase 1/2 under:
    /global/noscrub/George.Gayno/g2_lib.  On Theia, a copy
    is here: /scratch4/NCEPDEV/da/noscrub/George.Gayno/g2_v2.5.0.
    On WCOSS-Cray: /gpfs/hps/emc/global/noscrub/George.Gayno/g2_lib
    On WCOSS-Dell: /gpfs/dell2/emc/modeling/noscrub/George.Gayno/ip2lib.git/g2_lib

    On WCOSS-Phase1/2, WCOSS-Cray, WCOSS-Dell and Theia, these environment
    variables are set via modules in the build script.
    These settings may be overidden or set (if running
    on a machine other than WCOSS or Theia) by manually
    setting the environment variables on the command line
    line before running "make_reg_tests.ksh".  

    Example (if using tcsh):

    setenv W3NCO_LIB4 $pathname/libw3nco_4.a
    setenv SP_LIB4 $pathname/libsp_4.a
    ... and so on ...

(5) Build the regression tests suite.

    The suite is built with the "./reg_tests/make_reg_tests.ksh" script.
    (On WCOSS-Cray, use "make_reg_tests_wcoss-cray.sh".)

    By default, the Intel Fortran compiler is used.  The compiler,
    compiler flags and link flags are stored in ./config-setup/ifort.setup,
    which is sourced by the build script.  To use the "crayftn.setup" file
    (only on WCOSS-Cray) or your own setup file, you will need to manually
    edit the build script.

    To build, type "make_reg_tests.ksh" (use "make_reg_tests_wcoss-cray.sh
                                         on WCOSS-Cray).

    Log output from the 'ctl' and 'test' builds will be in the
    config*log files.  There will be six executables for
    each individual regression test (one for each 'ctl' and 'test' library version).
    These executables will be located in the ./exec sub-directory for
    the regression test.  The source code is in the ./sorc sub-directory.

(6) Kickoff the regression test suite.

    There are driver run scripts for WCOSS and Theia located in
    ./reg_tests. 

    To start the tests on WCOSS-Phase 1/2, simply type the script name -
    Runall.wcoss.ksh - on the command line.  A series of
    "daisy-chained" jobs steps will be submitted.  To check
    the job queue type "bjobs".

    On WCOSS-Cray, start the tests by invoking the "Runall.wcoss-cray.ksh" 
    script on the command line.   A series of  "daisy-chained" jobs steps
    will be submitted.  To check the job queue type "bjobs".

    On WCOSS-Dell (Phase 3), invoke the "Runall.wcoss-dell.sh" script 
    with no arguments.  A series of "daisy-chained" jobs will be submitted.
    To check the job queue, type "bjobs".

    On Theia, the "Runall.theia.ksh" script is used.  Before running, 
    set the project code that will be charged when running the test
    suite.  The project code is script variable $PROJECT_CODE. The
    default is the "fv3-cpu" project.  You may change the code by manually
    editing the script or doing "setenv PROJECT_CODE $code_name" on 
    the command line.  To find out which projects you
    are authorized to use, type "account_params".  After
    setting the project code, start the tests by typing
    "Runall.theia.ksh" on the command line.  A series of
    "daisy-chained" jobs steps will be submitted.  To check
    the job queue, type: "squeue -u USERNAME"
    
(7) Check results.

    On WCOSS-Phase1/2, the default run directory is /stmpp1/${LOGNAME}/regression
    On WCOSS-Cray, the default run directory is /gpfs/hps/stmp/${LOGNAME}/regression
    On WCOSS-Dell, the default run directory is /gpfs/dell1/stmp/${LOGNAME}/regression
    On Theia, the default run directory is /scratch3/NCEPDEV/stmp1/$LOGNAME/regression
    (The run directory is variable $WORK_DIR in the driver script).

    Log output from the test suite will be in "regression.log"  To monitor as
    the suite is running, do: grep ">>>" regression.log
    
    Once the suite is complete, a summary is placed in "summary.log"   Any failures
    should be investigated.

---------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL REGRESSION TEST
---------------------------------------------------------------

The tests in the following subdirectories are designed to test 
a subset of IP2LIB.  It was too difficult to create a single test
that exercised every routine.  

1)  gdswzd - A fortran program that calls gdswzd
    and all of its child routines to calculate lat/lon and
    other map-related fields for several grids of
    of various map projections.
2)  ipolates - A fortran program that interpolates a global
    lat/lon grid of substrate temperature to several grids of various
    projections using the ipolates suite of routines.  All
    interpolation options are used:
      1) bilinear
      2) neighbor
      3) budget
      4) spectral
      5) bicubic
      6) neighbor-budget
    This test is run twice, with 1 and 4 threads.
3)  ipolatev - A fortran program that interpolates a global
    lat/lon grid of vector u/v wind to several grids of various
    projections using the ipolatev suite of routines.  All
    interpolation options are used:
      1) bilinear
      2) neighbor
      3) budget
      4) spectral
      5) bicubic
      6) neighbor-budget
    This test is run twice, with 1 and 4 threads.
4)  ipxetas - A fortran program that calls routine ipxetas
    to transform between data on a staggered and unstaggered
    eta grid (rotated lat/lon with arakawa "e" staggering):
      1) Create staggered mass data from unstaggered data.
      2) Create staggered velocity data from unstaggered data.
      3) Create unstaggered data from staggered mass data.
      4) Create unstaggered data from staggered velocity data.
5)  ipxwafs - Test routines ipxwafs, ipxwafs2 and ipxwafs3 by 
    transforming data between 'full' and 'thinned' WAFS grids 37 and 44.
    Routine ixpwafs does not handle bitmapped data, so a field of
    600mb temperature is transformed when testing this routine.  
    Routines ipxwafs2/3 do handle bitmaps, so a field of soil temperature
    (land only) is transformed.
6)  copygb2 - A modified version of the copygb2 program is used to 
    transform global lat/lon fields of u/v wind, terrain height, and
    maximum snow albedo to the following grids types:
      1) global 0.5-degree
      2) mercator (ncep grid 8)
      3) t254 gaussian
      4) nh polar stereographic
      5) lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)
    All interpolation options are used:
      1) bilinear
      2) neighbor
      3) budget
      4) spectral
      5) bicubic
      6) neighbor-budget
    Because this tests calls the same routines as other regression
    tests, it is not currently called from the regression driver scripts.
    However, it may be run stand-alone using the scripts in ./copygb2/scripts.

Within each regression directory, the ./sorc subdirectory will contain the
source code and make-related files required for the regression test. A script
to run the individual regression test is under the ./scripts subdirectory.
The executables (after compilation) are stored under the ./exec subdirectory.
Any input data is stored in the ./data subdirectory.  Grads control files
to view any binary output data are stored in the ./grads subdirectory.  Some 
Grads control files do not have map backgrounds specified.  They are only 
used to sanity check the data.  So when viewing, do a 'set mproj off'. 

More detailed information about each test is described in a README file in that
test's subdirectory.

Below is a table of a routine or module and which regression test(s) invoke it.
