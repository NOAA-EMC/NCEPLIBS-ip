A. The easy (I hope) way...
===========================

To build the single (_4), double (_8), and mixed (_d) precision ip
libraries, you can use the "make_ip_lib.sh" script specifying the
build configuration. Type

  $ make_ip_lib.sh -h

to get the usage information for the script.

The available build configurations to use are:

  gfortran-debug.setup  ifort-debug.setup  pgf95-debug.setup  xlf2003-debug.setup
  gfortran.setup        ifort.setup        pgf95.setup        xlf2003.setup

So, on WCOSS/tide/gyre you would type:

  $ make_ip_lib.sh ifort.setup


On zeus you could do the same, or if you wanted to the PGI compiler,

  $ make_ip_lib.sh pgf95.setup


This script iterates over the single (_4), double (_8), and mixed (_d) precision
build configurations setting the appropriate default real and integer precision
promotion compiler switches.

Some additional points:
- The "NCO-type" install is performed by default.
- The libraries are installed relative to the current directory. After
  running the script you should see two new directories containing the 
  single (4), double (8), and mixed (d) precision libraries.
- See section B.4 below for information about the installation directory
  structure

You can tailor the build process using this "make_ip_lib.sh" script by
modifying the relevant build configuration setup file in the "config-setup/"
subdirectory.

Or, if you are going to be testing library builds multiple times, you can
create your own configuration setup file.



B. The more flexible way
========================

1. Configuration
----------------

If you need more flexibility in the library build you can specify the necessary 
information directly to the configure script that generates the makefiles. For
example, on WCOSS/tide:

  $ ./configure --prefix=${PWD} \
                --enable-promote=4|8|d \
                FC="ifort" \
                FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -traceback -fixed"

The --prefix switch sets the installation directory and defaults to /usr/local so
make sure you set it to a directory in which you have write access.

The --enable-promote switch allows you to specify the type of precision build be it
single (4), double (8), or mixed (d) precision. To build the mixed precision library
you would use:

  --enable-promote=d

Not specifying this switch is equivalent to "--enable-promote=4".

The definition of the "FC" enviroment variable is not strictly necessary as it defaults
to "ifort" on linux systems if available (followed by "gfortran" and "pgf95" if not), and
to "xlf2003" on AIX systems.




2. Building the library
-----------------------

To start the library build for a particular configuration, simply type

  $ make




3. Testing the library
----------------------

We don't have any package-level tests for ip yet. Sorry! They're coming...




4. Installing the library
-------------------------

Installation of the library *always* occurs into its own directory within the
directory specified by the --prefix switch. The name of the installation 
directory follows the convention:

  <library name>_<version>_<precision>

So, if a library version (say, v2.0.1) build was configured with --prefix=$PWD
for the default precision (4) build, then the installation directory will be

  ${PWD}/ip_v2.0.1_4
 


NCO Install
...........

To install the library conforming to the NCO organisation and naming conventions,
type:

  $ make nco_install

For a library version (say, v2.0.1) and the default precision (4), this will create
a directory called "ip_v2.0.1_4". That directory is organised according to the
current NCO structure on WCOSS in /nwprod/lib, as shown below:

  ip_v2.0.1_4/
    |
    |--libip_v2.0.1_4.a
    |
    `--incmod/
         |
         `--ip_v2.0.1_4/

The contents of the "ip_v2.0.1_4" directory can then be moved into the official
/nwprod/lib location as needed.

Note the include/ directory may not be present, or be empty, if no *.mod
files are generated during the build.

Let's assume the above install was moved into "/usrx/local/nceplibs", to use the
library in this structure in your own application, the usual environment variables
would be modified something like:

  libroot="/usrx/local/nceplibs"
  FCFLAGS="-I${libroot}/incmod/ip_v2.0.1_4 ${FCFLAGS}"
  LDFLAGS="-L${libroot} ${LDFLAGS}"
  LIBS="-lip_v2.0.1_4"



GNU Install
...........

To perform a GNU-type install, type:

  $ make install

For a library version (say, v2.0.1) and the default precision (4), this will create
a directory called "ip_v2.0.1_4". That directory structure is shown below:

  ip_v2.0.1_4/
    |
    |--include/
    |
    `--lib/
         |
         `--libip.a

Things to note:
 1) The only versioned item in this type of install is the name of the
    installation directory itself.
 2) The include/ directory may not be present, or be empty, if no *.mod
    files are generated during the build.

Let's assume the above install was moved into "/usrx/local/nceplibs", to use the
library in this structure in your own application, the usual environment variables
would be modified something like:

  libroot="/usrx/local/nceplibs"
  FCFLAGS="-I${libroot}/ip_v2.0.1_4/include ${FCFLAGS}"
  LDFLAGS="-L${libroot}/ip_v2.0.1_4/lib ${LDFLAGS}"
  LIBS="-lip"



Uninstalling the library
........................

To uninstall the library (assuming you haven't moved the installation directory
contents somewhere else) you can type:

  $ make uninstall
  
This will delete the created installation directory. So, for a library version
(say, v2.0.1) and the default precision (4), if your configure script invocation
was something like

  $ ./configure --prefix=${PWD} ...other command line arguments...

then the "uninstall" target will delete the "${PWD}/ip_v2.0.1_4" directory.




5. Cleaning up
--------------

Two targets are provided for cleaning up after the build. To remove all the 
build products type

  $ make clean

To also remove all the configuration products (i.e. the makefiles) type

  $ make distclean
